| `TRUST_PROXY`               | This tells the Lightdash server that it can trust the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header it receives in requests.

| `STATIC_IP`                 | Server static IP so users can add the IP to their warehouse allow-list.                                                                                                                                       |           | `http://localhost:8080`                                         |
