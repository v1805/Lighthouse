# Usage analytics

Each project has usage analytics which are dashboards created by Lightdash giving you an overview of your project's content and user activity. 

To see your usage analytics dashboards for a project, just click on the `settings` icon, `project settings`, then `usage analytics`.

Or you can also use our [search bar](https://docs.lightdash.com/guides/exploring-your-content#using-the-search-bar) to get direct access to 
the different analytics dashboards by typing the name of the dashboard (eg: User activity)
