# IP addresses to allow-list

Since we host your Lightdash for you, you may need to add our static IP addresses to the allow-list for your security group or firewall rules so they donâ€™t block calls from your Lightdash Cloud to your connected databases.

If you login at:
- **app.lightdash.cloud** use **35.245.81.252**
- **eu1.lightdash.cloud** use **34.79.239.130**

If you login at a different domain, look for the IP in the project settings page.
