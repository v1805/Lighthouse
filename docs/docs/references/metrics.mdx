# Metrics reference sheet

A metric is a value that describes or summarizes features from a collection of data points.
For example, `Num unique user ids` is a metric. It describes the unique number of `user_id`s in a collection of `user_id` data points.

In Lightdash, metrics are used to summarize dimensions or, sometimes, other metrics.

---

## Adding metrics to your project

There are two ways to add metrics to your project in Lightdash:

1. (**Suggested**) [Using the `meta` tag](#using-the-meta-tag)
2. [Using dbt's `metrics` tag](#using-dbts-metrics-tag) (this is still an Alpha feature)

### 1. Using the column `meta` tag (Suggested)

To add a metric to Lightdash using the `meta` tag, you define it in your dbt project under the dimension name you're trying to describe/summarize.

```version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    columns:
      - name: user_id # dimension name of your metric
        meta:
          metrics:
            num_unique_user_ids: # name of your metric
              type: count_distinct # metric type
            num_user_ids:
              type: count
```

Once you've got the hang of what these metrics look like, read more about the [metric types you can use below.](#metric-types)

### 2. Using the model `meta` tag

Sometimes a metric references many columns, in these cases you can define the metric at the model level:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: my_model
    meta:
      metrics:
        num_unique_user_ids:
          type: count_distinct
          sql: ${TABLE}.user_id
```

### 3. Using dbt's `metrics` tag

You can also add some metric to Lightdash using dbt's `metrics` tag in your model's `.yml` file. Here's a tutorial explaining how to do it:

[![demo create dbt metrics](./assets/loom-adding-dbt-metrics.png)](https://www.loom.com/share/811d8f71a3864a74a4849bdb164e7a4b)

So, metrics defined using dbt's `metrics` tag look something like this:

```yaml
# schema.yml
version: 2
metrics:
  - name: customer_count
    label: DBT METRIC!
    model: ref('customers')
    description: "A NEW DBT METRIC nuuuuuts"
    calculation_method: count_distinct
    expression: customer_id # must be a simple column name that you want to apply this metric to
    meta:
      hidden: false
```

:::info

Using the `metrics` tag has a couple of limitations (a.k.a. "features" ðŸ˜‰) in Lightdash we think are worth pointing out. Read more about them below.

:::

- **The `expression` field must be a simple column name.**

It should be the column name that you want to apply your metric to (e.g. `customer_id` for the metric `total_customers`). Itcannot be anything more than a column name.

The reason for this limitation is that dbt assumes metrics are only from a single table. In Lightdash, metrics can be queried from many tables.

If you are using `calculation_method: derived` then you may reference other metrics such as `expression: metric('a')/metric('b')`

```yaml
# All non-derived metrics must be a single column name:
metrics:
  - name: customer_count
    calculation_method: count_distinct
    expression: customer_id # ok
  - name: active_ratio
    calculation_method: derived
    expression: metric('active_customer_count') / metric('customer_count') # ok
```

- **Metrics automatically get all dimensions on the model**

  The dbt metrics spec asks the user to specify explicit columns on the model that apply to that metric. So for a `customer_count` metric, a user might request that only 3 columns apply as valid dimensions for that metric. We ignore this because in the Lightdash UI a model simply shows all metrics and dimensions of that model.

- **Metrics under the `meta:` tag on specific models take precedent over project metrics under the `metrics:` tag**

  For example, if we have two metrics for `customer_count`: one using the dbt `metrics` tag and the other using the `meta` tag,

  ``` yaml
  metrics:
    - name: customer_count
      calculation_method: count_distinct
      expression: customer_id
      model: customers
  ```

  ```yaml
  models:
    - name: customers
      columns:
        - name: customer_id
          meta:
            metrics:
              customer_count:
                type: count
  ```

  The second metric has the same name `customer_count` on the same model `customers` but the first uses type: count_distinct and the second uses type: count. Because the second metric is defined on the column `meta:` tag, it'll take priority over the first.

- The `calculation_method` must be [one of the Lightdash types](#metric-types).
- `timestamp`, `time_grains`, and `dimensions` are all ignored because metrics get all dimensions of the model.

## Metric Categories

Each metric type falls into one of these categories. The metric categories tell you whether the metric type is an aggregation and what type of fields the metric can reference:

### Aggregate metrics

Aggregate metric types perform (surprise, surprise) aggregations. Sums and averages are examples of aggregate metrics: they are measurements summarizing a collection of data points.

Aggregate metrics can *only* reference dimensions, not other metrics.

### Non-aggregate metrics

Non-aggregate metrics are metric types that, you guessed it, do *not* perform aggregations.

Numbers and booleans are examples of non-aggregate metrics. These metric types perform a calculation on a single data point, so they can only reference aggregate metrics. They *cannot* reference dimensions.

## Metric configuration

You can customize your metrics in your dbt model's YAML file. Here's an example of the properties used in defining a metric:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        description: "Total estimated revenue in GBP based on forecasting done by the finance team."
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_revenue:
              label: 'Total revenue GBP'
              type: SUM
              description: "Total revenue in GBP"
              sql: "IF(${revenue} IS NULL, 10, ${revenue})"
              hidden: false
              round: 0
              format: 'gbp'
              show_underlying_values:
                - revenue
                - forecast_date
                - web_sessions.session_id # field from joined table
              filters:
                - is_adjusted: true
```

Here are all of the properties you can customize:

| Property                                            | Required | Value                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

This is what you'll see in Lightdash instead of the metric name.                                                                                                                                                                       |

### percentile

Takes the percentile of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT` function.

The `percentile` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `median_price` by taking the 50% percentile of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        median_price:
          type: percentile
          percentile: 50
```

### median

Takes the 50th percentile of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5)` function.

The `median` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `median_price` by taking the 50% percentile of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        median_price:
          type: median
```

### average

Takes the average (mean) of the values in the given field. Like SQL's `AVG` function.

The `average` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `avg_price` by taking the average of the `item_price` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        avg_price:
          type: average
```

### boolean

Tells you whether something is True or False.

The `boolean` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics *or* [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `boolean` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

`boolean` metrics don't do any aggregations; they just reference other aggregations.

For example, the `avg_price` metric below is an average of all of the `item_price` values in our product table. A second metric called `is_avg_price_above_20` is a `boolean` type metric. The `is_avg_price_above_20` metric has a custom SQL expression that tells us whether the `avg_price` value is greater than 20.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: item_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        avg_price:
          type: average
        is_avg_price_above_20:
          type: boolean
          sql: "IF(${avg_price} > 20, TRUE, FALSE)"
```

### count

Does a table count, like SQLâ€™s `COUNT` function.

The `count` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `number_of_users` by counting the number of `user_id` values in the table:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: user_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        number_of_users:
          type: count
```

### count_distinct

Counts the number of distinct values in a given field. It's like SQLâ€™s `COUNT DISTINCT` function.

The `count_distinct` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `number_of_unique_users` by counting the number of unique `user_id` values in the table:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: user_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        number_of_unique_users:
          type: count_distinct
```

### date

Gives you a date value from an expression.

The `date` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a date value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics *or* [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `date` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

To be honest, `date` metrics are pretty rarely used because most SQL aggregate functions don't return dates. The only common use of this metric is if you use a `MIN` or `MAX` on a date dimension.

```yaml
columns:
  - name: date_updated
    meta:
      metrics:
        most_recent_date_updated:
          type: date
          sql: "MAX(${date_updated})"
```

### max

Max gives you the largest value in a given field. It's like SQLâ€™s `MAX` function.

The `max` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `max_delivery_cost` by looking at the `delivery_cost` dimension and taking the largest value it finds:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: delivery_cost
    meta:
      metrics:
        max_delivery_cost:
          type: max
```

### min

Min gives you the smallest value in a given field. It's like SQLâ€™s `MIN` function.

The `min` metric can be used on any dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a set of values.

For example, this creates a metric `min_delivery_cost` by looking at the `delivery_cost` dimension and taking the smallest value it finds:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: delivery_cost
    meta:
      metrics:
        min_delivery_cost:
          type: min
```

### number

Used with numbers or integers. A `number` metric doesn't perform any aggregation but can be used to perform simple transformations on other metrics.

The `number` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a numeric or integer value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics *or* [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `number` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

For example, this creates a metric called `total_gross_profit_margin_percentage` based on the `total_sale_price` and `total_gross_profit_margin` aggregate metrics:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: sale_price
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_sale_price:
          type: sum
  - name: gross_profit_margin
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_gross_profit_margin:
          type: sum
        total_gross_profit_margin_percentage:
          type: number
          sql: "(${total_gross_profit_margin}/ NULLIF(${total_sale_price},0))"
```

The example above also uses the NULLIF() SQL function to avoid division-by-zero errors.

### sum

Adds up the values in a given field. Like SQLâ€™s `SUM` function.

The `sum` metric can be used on any numeric dimension or, [for custom SQL](#using-custom-SQL-in-aggregate-metrics), any valid SQL expression that gives a numeric table column.

For example, this creates a metric `total_revenue` by adding up the values in the `revenue` dimension:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: revenue

### string

Used with fields that include letters or special characters.

The `string` metric can be used on any valid SQL expression that gives you a string value. It can only be used on aggregations, which means either aggregate metrics *or* [custom SQL that references other metrics](#using-custom-sql-in-non-aggregate-metrics). You cannot build a `string` metric by referencing other unaggregated dimensions from your model.

`string` metrics are rarely used because most SQL aggregate functions don't return strings. One common exception is MySQLâ€™s `GROUP_CONCAT` function.

For example, this creates a metric `product_name_group` by combining the unique values of a dimension called `product_name`:

```yaml
columns:
  - name: product_name
    meta:
      metrics:
        product_name_group:
          type: string
          sql: "GROUP_CONCAT(${product_name})"
```

## Adding your own metric descriptions

We add default descriptions to all of the metrics you include in your model. But, you can override these using the description parameter when you define your metric.

```yaml
metrics:
  num_user_ids:
    type: count
    description: "Total number of user IDs. NOTE: this is NOT counting unique user IDs"
```

## Using custom SQL in aggregate metrics

You can include custom SQL in your metric definition to build more advanced metrics using the sql parameter.
Inside the sql parameter, you can reference any other dimension from the given model and any joined models. You **canâ€™t reference other metrics.**

You can reference dimensions from the same model like this: `sql: "${dimension_in_this_model}"`
Or from joined models like this: `sql: "${other_model.dimension_in_other_model}"`

```yaml
metrics:
  num_unique_7d_web_active_user_ids:
    type: count_distinct # metric type
    sql: "IF(${is_7d_web_active}, ${user_id}, NULL)"
  num_unique_paid_user_ids:
    type: count_distinct
    sql: "IF(${subscriptions.is_active}, ${user_id}, NULL)"
```

## Using custom SQL in non-aggregate metrics

In non-aggregate metrics, you can reference any other metric from the given model and any joined models. You **canâ€™t reference other dimensions.**

You can reference metrics from the same model like this: `sql: "${metric_in_this_model}"`
Or from joined models like this: `sql: "${other_model.metric_in_other_model}"`

```yaml
metrics:
  num_unique_users:
      type: count_distinct
  is_num_unique_users_above_100:
    type: boolean
    sql: "IF(${num_unique_users} > 100, TRUE, FALSE)"
  percentage_user_growth_daily:
    type: number
    sql: "(${num_unique_users} - ${growth_model.num_unique_users_lag_1d}) / NULLIF(${growth_model.num_unique_users_lag_1d}, 0)"
```

## Show underlying values

By default, we show all of the dimensions from the Table when you click `View underlying data`. If you have fields from a joined table included in your results table, then we'll also show you all of the fields from the joined Table.

<img src={UnderlyingData} width="1103" height="580" style={{display: "block", margin: "0 auto 20px auto"}}/>

You can limit which dimensions are shown for a field when a user clicks `View underlying data` by adding the list of dimensions to your `.yml` files:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: "Unique ID for users."
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              show_underlying_values:
                - revenue_gbp_total_est
                - actual_date
                - web_sessions.session_id # field from joined table
...
```

The list of fields must be made of dimension names (no metrics) from the base table or from any joined tables. To reference a field from a joined table, you just need to prefix the dimension name with the joined table name, like this: `my_joined_table_name.my_dimension`.

The order that the fields are listed in `show_underlying_values` is the order that they'll appear in on the `view underlying data` table.

## Compact values

You can compact values in your YAML. For example, if I wanted all of my revenue values to be shown in thousands (e.g. `1,500` appears as `1.50K`), then I would write something like this in my .yml:

```yaml
	version: 2
	models:
	- name: sales
	  columns:
	    - name: revenue
	      meta:
	        dimension:
	            compact: thousands # You can also use 'K'
```

| Value     | Alias              | Example output |
|-----------|--------------------|----------------|
| thousands | "K" and "thousand" | 1K             |
| millions  | "M" and "million"  | 1M             |
| billions  | "B" and "billion"  | 1B             |
| trillions | "T" and "trillion" | 1T             |

## Filters

Filters are applied to metrics any time that metric is used in Lightdash.

For example, we could add a filter to our users count to make sure it didn't include user IDs with closed accounts, like this:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: "Unique ID for users."
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              filters:
                - is_closed_account: false
...
```

These filters do not appear in the `Filters` tab in the Explore view, instead, they are applied automatically in the SQL query that fetches your results. That means filters added using the `filter` parameter can't be removed in the UI and won't be visible to users unless they look at the SQL query.

### Available filter types

| Type                        | Example (in English)                           | Example (as code)     |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| is equal to                 | User name is equal to katie                    | `user_name: katie`    |
| is not equal to             | User name is not equal to katie                | `user_name: !katie`   |
| contains                    | User name contains katie                       | `user_name: %katie%`  |
| does not contain            | User name does not contain katie               | `user_name: !%katie%` |
| starts with                 | User name starts with katie                    | `user_name: katie%`   |
| is greater than             | Number of orders is greater than 4             | `num_orders: '> 4'`   |
| is greater than or equal to | Number of orders is greater than or equal to 4 | `num_orders: '>= 4'`  |
| is less than                | Number of orders is less than 4                | `num_orders: '< 4'`   |
| is less than or equal to    | Number of orders is less than or equal to 4    | `num_orders: '<= 4'`  |


:::info

To use special characters such as `%!_>` in your filter value you must escape them with a backslash `\`. For example,
if you wanted to filter for users with subscription status `is_subscribed` you should write the metric like:


```yaml
columns:
  - name: user_id
    meta:
      metrics:
        total_subscribed_users:
          type: count_distinct
          filters:
            - subscription_status: is\_subscribed
```

:::

### If you have many filters in your list, they will be joined using `AND`.

For example:

```yaml
filters:
  - is_closed_account: false
  - is_7d_active: true
...
```

Would give you logic like `is_closed_account = TRUE AND is_7d_active = FALSE`.

### You can filter using fields from either the base model, or any joined models.

To filter using a field from a joined model, just use the syntax `model_name.field`, like this:

```yaml
version: 2

models:
  - name: sales_stats
    meta:
      joins:
        - join: web_sessions
          sql_on: ${web_sessions.date} = ${sales_stats.date}
    columns:
      - name: user_id
        description: "Unique ID for users."
        meta:
          dimension:
            type: string
          metrics:
            count_users:
              type: count_distinct
              filters:
                - is_closed_account: false
                - web_sessions.is_bot_user: false
...
```
